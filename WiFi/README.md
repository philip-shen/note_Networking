```  
The “Pre-Shared Key” (PSK) method of WPA2 is replaced by “Simultaneous Authentication of Equals” (SAE), 
which offers a more robust password-based authentication. 

The passphrase itself is no longer used for key derivation (keyword: “Pairwise Master Key” (PMK)), 

the key derivation is based on “Elliptic Curve Cryptography” (ECC) or a special form of ECC with integer numbers only called “Finite Field” instead.
