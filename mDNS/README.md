# Abstract  
Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link 
in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server.  
In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, 
without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise 
configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names.

The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that 
(i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, 
(ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and 
(iii) they work during infrastructure failures.

# 1.  Introduction  
Multicast DNS and its companion technology DNS-Based Service Discovery [RFC6763](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763) 
were created to provide IP networking with the ease-of-use and autoconfiguration for which 
AppleTalk was well-known [RFC6760].  When reading this document, familiarity with the concepts of 
Zero Configuration Networking [Zeroconf] and automatic link-local addressing [RFC3927] [RFC4862] is helpful.

Multicast DNS borrows heavily from the existing DNS protocol [RFC1034] [RFC1035] [RFC6195], using 
**the existing DNS message structure, name syntax, and resource record types.**  
This document specifies no new operation codes or response codes.  
This document describes how clients send DNS-like queries via IP multicast, and 
how a collection of hosts cooperate to collectively answer those queries in a useful manner.
